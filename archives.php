        <p>In order to make sense of design in Ireland now and into the future, the 100 Archive creates an annual selection of 100 examples of contemporary communication design each year, while also recording the designers, collaborators and clients who make it happen. Some of our selections are now part of the NLI Web Archive. We have archive selections from 2010 onwards, explore them here.</p>

            <p>2017's selection once again proves that Ireland can genuinely claim to be one of Europe's design capitols. Not one that borrows its cues from established hubs such as the UK, The Netherlands or Scandinavia, but one that has carved out its own identity within the European design landscape. There's a sophistication to ideation and warmth to craft and execution that I feel is unique to Irish design today.</p>

            <p>When we reflect back on the 100 Archive for each year I think it's as important for the selection to tell a story of where design was at in that particular year, but also what we were thinking as a society: what some of the themes and concerns were in business, in culture and in our day to day lives. </p>
